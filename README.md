### What the app does:
- Users are authenticated via Google, Facebook, or Twitter passport strategies
- Authenticated users can create polls (with any number of options) and get a custom URL for their poll.
- Both authenticated and unauthenticated users can vote on polls.
- Authenticated users can create a new option on any user's poll.
- Both authenticated and unauthenticated users can see the results of a poll in a bar graph (using Chart.js).
- Authenticated users can see the polls they've created, and delete polls they don't want anymore.
- Both authenticated and unauthenticated users can view all the polls all users have created.
